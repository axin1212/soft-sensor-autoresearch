# FDE Integration

Discover local FDE in this order:

1. Explicit `--fde-root`
2. `FDE_SOURCE_PATH`
3. The current working directory and parents
4. Sibling `FDE` or `benchmark` directories

Accept either a full FDE checkout with `packages/kernels`, or the benchmark snapshot with `vendor/fde_packages` and `contestants/2_scoPe_regressor`.

Required behavior:

- Fail if TabPFN3 or its local weights are unavailable.
- Do not silently switch to XGBoost as the prediction model.
- XGBoost is allowed only for feature screening and Top-32 ranking.
- Prefer FDE's existing trend/frequency window feature builders when importable.

Outputs are offline fitability validation artifacts, not online deployment backtests.
